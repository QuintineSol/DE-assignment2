# Data Engineering - Assignment 2

## Pipeline 1
- Use-case: Which team has the most coaches/players who received an award?
- Visualisation: histogram with different colours
    - x-axis: teams
    - y-axis: amount of awards - one colour per category

## Pipeline 2
- Use-case: Which player/goalie performs the best in shootouts for each team? 
- Visualisation: table
    - column 1: team name
    - column 2-4: name of best goalie 1, 2 and 3
    - column 5-7: name of best player 1, 2 and 3

Each of these pipelines actually contain 2 use-cases. Therefore, we can either pick one focus (e.g. coaches, players or goalies) for each question. Alternatively, we can create 4 pipelines.
